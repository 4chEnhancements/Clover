To PR to the ReadMe list include:
- Name, make a descriptive one up if needed for one-off/small userscripts
  - Brief summary of what it does (optional)
  - Git repository, (optional - link Name)

To PR to the repo itself:
- Create a folder
- Include a ReadMe with the same information as adding it to the list. PR's for adding a userstyle without including a screenshot of what the styles will look like will be rejected.
